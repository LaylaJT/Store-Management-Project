# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.


## Description

- I made a store that sells basketball clothes because basketball is my favorite sport. It sells besketball jerseys and shorts. The user can chose which piece of clothing they woud like to purchase, whether it is a nike or adidas jersey or shorts. For the jerseys, there are different sizes, S for small, M for medium, L for large, XL for Extra Large. For the shorts, there are different lengths such as short and/or long. Some brands have only certain sizes so the "this" keyword is used much like return ands super(). Once you select both a jersey and shorts, they purchase them and the output says thank you and goodbye.
